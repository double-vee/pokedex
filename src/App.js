/* Routing is not complete, please add missing part of the router to make it work properly

Take a look at list of imported components!!!

HINT: Missing routes are
* /pokemons
* /favourites
* /

If you get stuck here refer to first pages of react-router documentation. I literally copied code from their tutorial

* Later you'll have to comeback here to add additional route for /pokemons/:id but you'll know it when you get there
